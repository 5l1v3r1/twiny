Small console tool for twitting

### My old project (doesn't work with Twitter anymore)

**Twiny** is a small(~20 K with UPX packing, and ~60 K without) utility for twitting.

Now you can not turn off the console and open up another program or browser, just type

```twiny "My new status :)"```

or

```twiny My new status :')'```

and new status will appear on your page on twitter.com.

Such special symbols you must write as
